        THE GLASS SWORD  
             CHAPTER 1:  

                                            THAT'S THE START  

  

New Zealand was once full of terror, every street there were billions of robots. The evil man Marcus wanted to make every single Kiwi a robot he had also made my parents a slave he turned them into robots, by the way, my name is Freddy carter and I am 13. My only dream Is to take the Glass sword and kill Marcus and have my parents back.  

  

                                  Chapter: 2  

                           READY, FREDDY  

  

Freddy reallly wanted the glass sword but Marcus knew that Freddy was a special one he could handle anything. Freddy was only the Kiwi which was not a robot and Marcus wanted him to be a robot too, Freddy saved himself many times he had attacked him many times. There was another group of people who were not robots and Freddy wanted to join that. That group also wanted to have the glass sword and set every Kiwi free. Freddy got ready to join the group and met his robot parents in the middle he was really angry about Marcus.  

  

                               Chapter 3:  

                             Joins July  

  Finally, Freddy joined The group the group's name was: July. July was a very nice group for hiding they wore clothes and masks like robots so no-one could realize. They also had a big lab, oh did introduce you to July, In July there are 3 children in and were of my age: Pin the leader pin was the smartest and strongest. He was also a horse rider.  

Quint: Quint was a science student and loved experiments his freaky jelly ball was famous in July. Gaby: Gaby too was a horse rider.  

There were 3 horses in July:  

Elvis and Raven and Ariel  

Gaby had ariel and Pin had Raven and they gave me a horse I named him Elvis  

Chapter 4:  

                       Marcus, you're going to go down  

  

I and Pin had made an amazing plan we were waiting outside the cave and we knew it would be difficult to fight with the knights and every single kiwi knew that the protecting knights of the Glass sword are scared of horses so Pin and I rode inside the cave and Elvis suddenly took a high jump over the big rock and saved me from falling. I pet Elvis and again we started to go suddenly Raven and Elvis whinnied and they knew something was going to happen so we got ready.   

  

                              Chapter 5:  

                    Are Knights scared of horses?  

  

We went a little forward and the knights took out their swords Pin also took out his sword which he hung on Raven's saddle but one Knight got scared and fainted because he saw horses but the other knights didn't seem to be scared by the 

 horses. I took out one of Quint's chemicals and threw it on one of the knights the knight died. Then I took out my sword too! Then from the backside Gaby riding on ariel and Quint with his chemicals entered the cave. 


   

  

                            Chapter 6:  

                        Glass sword  

They had a large war Quint was badly hurt and Ariel got a cut on her leg too she was also injured She was constantly neighing, and Gaby had to stay with her so Pin and I took over and Smashed the Knights they  finally lost and we went to the last door and we took out the sword from the case carefully because we knew that there would be a 2nd attack and suddenly firing started happening but I had a Shield on Elvis's Saddle and we finished the attack 2 also. One agent robot of Marcus was seeing everything and reported to Marcus. Marcus knew by the robots that they are getting the glass sword to kill him so he got all geared up.

                                    Chapter 7:  

                               END GAME   

Until we came back with the sword Quint was okay and ariel became as good as she was before and we all went to our lab and Quint took all his chemicals.  

Pin and I sharpened the Glass sword and 30 more swords we also took some knives. We were ready to go I added 2 more swords on Elvis's Saddle Pin did the same on Raven's Saddle and Gabby took all other swords in her bag and one shield on Ariels saddle and we went to Octane Marcus's office He was at the terrace armed with guns and trillions of robots which were not activated but according to our plan I went to the backside with the glass sword and secretly rode to his terrace door on Elvis and we smashed into Marcus and Marcus did not activate his robots so he could not attack and got killed Pin, Gaby and Quint started saying Freddy's name loudly they said: All hail to our king Freddy the joked. Then suddenly the robots started being humans again and everybody hailed Freddy. When every robot became a human so one of them says loudly is that Pin duke and Freddy, Gaby, and Quint were in shock that Pin was the duke and then all celebrated and Freddy, Gaby, Quint, and Duke Pin got their parents back. Then all the Kiwi's lived happily ever after.
